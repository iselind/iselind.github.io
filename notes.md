these are the things I feel are missing that I want to have fixed before publishing my site.
- [Adding post tagging](https://www.jasonemiller.org/2020/12/23/tagging-posts-in-jekyll-minima.html)
- Run my posts through Grammarly, primarily for spell checking
- ~~Write the About page~~
- ~~Get Disqus commenting started~~
- ~~Add stuff for Google Analytics~~
- Add stuff for Google Search Console, migth use the Google Analytics ID

~~This should not dissuade me from version controlling this repo in a properly named repository on Github.~~
