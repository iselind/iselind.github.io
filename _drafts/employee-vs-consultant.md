title: Employee vs. Consultant
---

Both employees and consultants usually do similar work. They are working under different contexts giving them each certain advantages the other will not enjoy in the same way.

## The Employee
An employee helps the employer, a company, perpetuate itself.  In the end an employee boils down to being a tool to perpetuate someone else's dream (i.e. the company).

In return the company takes care of the employee, as it would any other tool. Well, to some degree. The employer is only interested in maintaining tools to the extent it's in their interest.

For example, an employer want their tools to cost as little as possible, hence, most companies will maintain the salary at the minimum level the employee can accept. Would you be interested in paying more for your tools than you have to?

The employee on the other hand often require a means to earn a living. Combining these aspects becomes a balancing act for the employee where the salary is balanced against being able to do the work for a long time.

## The Consultant
There are two kinds of consultants; the resource pool and those with distinguished skill sets. Both have the option to buy services in the form of negotiation support and networking support.

### Being part of a resource Pool
In this category you fall into the category I'd like to call "body and brain for hire". You are still a tool, similar to an employee. You have advantages an employee does not, for example, you have a trained salesperson by your side when negotiating your salary and when it's time to search for something new you have someone else by your side with a massive network to draw from. You do not have to maintain any of that. You do have to pay for those services though.

### Having a distinguished skill set
In this category you are known for a specific skill set that is.

Usually those with the need for your services will come to you. You can usually charge quite well for your services. When you find yourself in need of more work you have to find someone with the need of your services. Hopefully that is a rare occurrence. If not you can buy access to others' vast networks.

Salary negotiations can be something you do yourself or use a salesperson. Regardless you'd adjust your rates according to the demand of your services. You increase your rate when you find it hard to keep up until you find the situation manageable again. You might find the need to lower your rate with demand as well though you could also use those times to recuperate.

Sure, these services might cost but you as a consultant is freed up to do the work you are meant to do, leaving everything else to others better suited to those tasks.

## The Comparison
To avoid comparing apples with pears we will only compare the employee to the resource pool version of the consultant. Neither can be compared to the consultant with a distinguished skill set.

The big difference I see between an employee and a consultant is that the consultant has bought in the services of salespeople and those with vast networks to facilitate negotiations and finding new opportunities. The employee has to take care of that on his or her own. An employee could probably use representation during negotiations. I've not seen or heard of that being done yet.

The only way I see we can incorporate the consultant with a distinguished skill set in this comparison is to look at this as a comparison matrix.

|  | You negotiate your salary | Salesperson negotiate your salary |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **You find your own work** | Employee | Resource Pool Consultant |
| **Someone else finds you work** | Consultant with distinguished skill set | Either kind of Consultant |
| **Others find you** | Consultant with distinguished skill set | Consultant with distinguished skill set |
