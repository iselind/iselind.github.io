You want to take control of your professional career, but have little to no guidance on how to do that.
If you were to succeed, it would allow you to 10x your output by working wiser and not harder.
You'd know what records to keep, and why, along with documentation of your achievements.

For this I rely on a very simple, but powerful, mental model: A company.
Using a company as a model might seem strange, primarily because you are not a company.
Most people do not own their own company either.
Owning stocks in companies does not count here.
You do not need to own a company to be guided by the model.

Some of the connections we will make seem obvious, though not so much so when applied to your situation.
Try to consider how the connection applies to your particular context.

## Understanding a company

We can regard a company as consisting of three pillars

- Customers
- Reputation
- Finances

They are, of course, linked.

You need customers to get income and a reputation. With a good reputation, you gain more customers. If you have a functioning business, customers and Reputation form a cycle where each feeds the other. Reputation comes from customer satisfaction with the provided product or service.

From this understanding, we can see that everything starts with the customer, where we will begin.

We will cover how You grow Your company, but we need a company to grow before that. We will start doing exactly that in another post.
