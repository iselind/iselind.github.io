You are working on a quite elaborate task.
For some reason you are tasked with something else to have your current task continued at a later date.
How do you keep track of what you have done so that you don't have to repeat work to see where you were?

We will limit this to elaborate tasks, i.e. tasks that require significant amounts of investigation for example.
The way of working I will describe here is simply not worth it for smaller tasks.
Where you draw the line is based on experience and entirely up to you.

Usually when we make discoveries during an investigation we experience a surge of energy we can use to keep the momentum going. We can longer count on that when taking context switching into account. Instead we have to keep track of our ideas, result, and progress through means that survive over time. We cannot rely on our memory either as it tends to be fragile, making many of us forget a lot. Instead, we have to turn to writing things down.

You can keep what you write to your self or keep it in the issue management tool you happen to use.
Regardless of your choice, you have to diligently write down your ideas, result, and progress.
The perhaps most important notes to take are where the dead ends are along with why.
The purpose is not to show that you were wrong.
You were in fact not wrong fro finding a dead end. It might be far from obvious that a path is a dead end until you have walked the path.

Once other tasks need your attention you can pause your current work quite quickly without loosing much pace precisely because you have records of your ideas, result, and progress. It will be short work to get back to where you were once that other work has been completed.

Keeping records of your thought process will allow others to learn how you arrived at the results and might see avenues you have overlooked.
Others have no chance to help you unless you recount your journey so far.
With elaborate tasks, that could mean that you need to account for months of work. That is far from easy!

Your team leader or manager might question why your task is taking so long. With your records in hand you can show exactly why.
Show your work!
