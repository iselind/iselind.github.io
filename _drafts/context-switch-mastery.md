You are working on a quite elaborate task.
For some reason you are tasked with something else to have your current task continued at a later date.
How do you keep track of what you have done so that you don't have to repeat work to see where you were?

We will limit this to elaborate tasks, i.e. tasks that require significant amounts of investigation for example.
The way of working I will describe here is simply not worth it for smaller tasks.
Where you draw the line is based on experience and entirely up to you.
