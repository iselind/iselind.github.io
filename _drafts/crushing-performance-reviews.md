You are regularly subjected to a performance review which contributes to your salary revision. Many don't know what to focus on and have the wrong frame of mind. We can fix that!

When I started working professionally and were subjected to these performance reviews I found no guidance for what I was supposed to do. Everyone had their own idea of what to prepare, with varying results. Being an engineer, I tried to systematize this and came to some incredibly useful insights that has guided me ever since. I'd like to share these with you in this post.

I started by dissecting what a performance review is, with which perspective it was conducted and so on. I realized that a performance review is a company's way to evaluate your performance, or usefulness really, to the company. That in turn contributes to your salary revision. Sounds obvious reading it like this, but at the time it was far from obvious.

Those insights showed me that what I need to focus on is what makes me a valuable asset to my employer.
The performance review is my time in the spot light enabling me to show why and how I am a valuable asset.

Equipped with this insight I set out documenting my valuable contributions, as they appear, making it easier to produce the list rather than trying to come up with the list on the fly. The source of the contributions come from both success and failure.
