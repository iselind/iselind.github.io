You are regularly subjected to a performance review which contributes to your salary revision. Many don't know what to focus on and have the wrong frame of mind. We can fix that!

When I started working professionally and were subjected to these performance reviews in 2008 I found no guidance for what I was supposed to do. Everyone had their own idea of what to prepare, with varying results. Being an engineer, I tried to systematize this and came eventually to some incredibly useful insights that has guided me ever since. I'd like to share these with you in this post.

I started by dissecting what a performance review is, with which perspective it was conducted and so on. I realized after some time that a performance review is a company's way to evaluate your performance, or usefulness really, to the company. That in turn contributes to, for example, your salary revision and career prospects. Sounds obvious reading it like this, but at the time it was far from obvious to me.

Those insights showed me that what I need to focus on is what makes me a valuable asset to my employer.
The performance review is my time in the spot light enabling me to show why and how I am a valuable asset.
It's Not the time to pull out the salary statistics from your union.

## Documenting
Equipped with this insight I set out documenting my valuable contributions, as they appear, making it easier to produce the document later rather than trying to come up with the document on the fly. The source of the contributions come from both success and failure.

It was not an easy realization but I came to the conclusions that I should not only focus on my successes, but also on my failures. It's similar to that interview question where you are asked what your biggest flaw is. It does Not come down to what issues you have, you can turn it to your advantage by focusing on how you turn your disadvantage to an advantage. This turn of events should both that you can handle defeat, and learn from it, but also that you are a down to earth person. Both are quite valuable to an employer. You can even mention other issues that your company have that you contributed to alleviating showing that you are not self-centered. All of this should be documented.

What should you document then?
In essence the relevant context for each and every achievement.
Here are a couple of examples to get you going.
- What was the problem? It might not be obvious to your employer why you thought that was a problem so don't forget that aspect.
- Risk or consequence if problem goes unattended. This is still your view and understanding you are portraying.
- Result. Not just that the problem was solved. How you solved the problem might not be relevant. Try using terminology that appeals to your employer like more efficient processes, cost reduction, and so on.
- Significant contributions by colleagues. Sharing credit shows not only your character but also that you are a team player.

Since it's your document, you can edit it whenever you remember something that contributes to your document.
That might seem like a detail but is quite valuable in itself when you think about it.
Where you not to have your document at all, then you would get exactly one try to produce the complete document.
Having the document at hand for a long time allows you thousands of opportunities to add to your document.
The document could be regarded as a living document that grows with you, making it valuable to you, so keep it safe.

## Why does this document matter?
Having that document matters, in a nutshell, because both you and your employer have short memory for achievements. Think about it, how many achievements can you list our right now for the past 365 days? Do you think your employer has any better recollection than you when it comes to Your achievements?

You can use the document you prepared to list far more achievements far more accurately.

When you are able to list significant achievements in amounts your colleagues cannot you will appear very valuable, which will help you when discussing, for example, salary revisions and career advancement. This might seem callus but consider a fictional colleague that is not contributing at all. Would such a person be able to out-list you? How could he or she? There are very limited amounts to list! Here you will appear more valuable, and rightly so.

Next, consider a colleague who is equal or even more valuable to the employer than you are. I know it might be hard to imagine, let's use our imagination. If this person is not as well prepared as you in showcasing how valuable he or she is, then you will still appear more valuable.

You are using your time more wisely by, for example, documenting you achievements. Shouldn't you be rewarded for your contributions?

Others will also make valuable contributions, of course, but they do not count as much if they cannot be listed when required.
