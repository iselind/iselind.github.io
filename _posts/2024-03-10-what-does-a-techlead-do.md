A tech lead can be tasked with many different tasks depending on the current
needs of the employer. This means that a tech lead does not do the same things
in all companies. The tech lead will interact with many different roles within
the company, and sometimes outside the company. I'd like to describe to you how
I approach the tech lead role. We'll end with looking at the most important
skills of a tech lead.

In broad terms I interact with the following roles
- Developers, both those with far less, comparable, and far more experience in
  certain topics than I have. No one has more experience at everything compared
  to anyone.
- Managers and above.

This means that I interact with most levels in the organization that is related
to where I am in the organization. Each of these four groups have different
needs and requirements on me as a tech lead.

Regardless of level I help break down tasks into manageable pieces and working
out a plausible order and schedule for the work.

## Developers
I try very hard to be the senior developer I would have wished or need to have
myself when I were at the experience level the developer I am currently
helping. This involves showing a lot of patience and being able to, for
example, describe concepts in a simplified way.

This is especially try when interacting with developers with far less
experience than myself.  This involves showing a lot of patience and being able
to, for example, describe concepts in a simplified way.

Developers with comparable or even more experience than me still come to me for
support. That is because I have established myself as someone that will never
laugh at you or your situation but try to help you. The help I can provide
someone with this level of experience is being a sounding board for thoughts
and ideas. There is limited need to explain concepts to each other. Instead we
exploit the fact that we have different experiences and perspectives. That
enables us to present alternative approaches or view points that lead to a path
forward.

Regardless of level of experience everyone get stuck at some point. Either from
having looked at the same thing for too long or some other reason. In these
situations it is invaluable to have access to a rubber duck. I can play that
role very well as a tech lead. Sometimes I just have to sit and listen while
the developer explains something to me. Other times I come with questions that
challenge or highlight something that is either assumed or might be missed.

All of this might sound very simple to do, but it requires a lot of experience.
You cannot help a beginner as well as when you yourself have passed that level
and know the pains and frustrations that come up. Most might be able to imagine
some of it, but experience is key.

## Managers
With managers and other leadership roles my role is quite different. Here my
role becomes making sense of requirements and keeping the discussions aligned
with where we are technically in the code.

This work tends to be more abstract or fluffy most of the time.

## The most important skills of them all
There are three skills that are important above and beyond all others being a
tech lead.
- Listening
- Admitting faults
- Admitting not knowing

Nothing will grow your good will and impact as well as mastering those three skills.

Admitting you messed up and that you do not know the answer to that particular
questions lets those around you see that you are human.

Being able to listen before you speak helps you not only understand what the
problem really is, you also see if the one you talk to want a solution or just
want to be listened to and have the opportunity to vent some frustration.

# The rest of my time
When not doing the above mentioned tasks I focus on improving the code base the developers work in. This could involve enabling better ways of testing or upgrading packages or language version. It could also revolve around planning ahead for scalability or managing vulnerabilities.

When not doing that I review changes either by picking some at random or because I was invited to review the change. If you are curious about my thoughts on reviewing, take a look at [my post on approaching reviews](/2024/03/16/approaching-reviewing).
