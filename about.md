Welcome to my site. This is my space for my thoughts and opinions based on numerous years of experience as a senior software developer.
If you do not agree with me or think I am missing an important aspect, let me know.
I'd appreciate hearing from you if you are helped by my posts.
Learning together with you would make my day!

My name is Patrik, I work as a tech lead. What that means to me can be read about in [my post on what a tech lead does]({% post_url 2024-03-10-what-does-a-techlead-do %}).

If you'd like to get in touch with me, use the comment sections in the posts or reach out on LinkedIn.
